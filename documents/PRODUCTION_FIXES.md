# Production Error Fixes & Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the fixes implemented to resolve production errors with HuggingFace API failures and web scraping timeouts during cron job execution.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. HuggingFace Embedding API Failures

**Problem**: `Error [ProviderApiError]: Failed to perform inference` during embedding generation

**Solutions Implemented**:

- ✅ **Robust Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with 3 retry attempts for transient errors
- ✅ **Graceful Fallback**: Zero vector embeddings when API fails completely
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: 500ms delays between API calls to avoid overwhelming the service
- ✅ **Sequential Processing**: Changed from parallel to sequential embedding generation
- ✅ **Better Error Detection**: Specific retry conditions for timeouts, rate limits, and service overloads

### 2. Web Scraping Timeout Issues

**Problem**: `Connect Timeout Error` when scraping article content

**Solutions Implemented**:

- ✅ **Timeout Control**: 10-second timeout with AbortController
- ✅ **Enhanced Headers**: More comprehensive browser-like headers
- ✅ **Better Selectors**: Extended list of article content selectors
- ✅ **Improved Fallback**: Better HTML-to-text conversion as backup
- ✅ **Graceful Degradation**: Continue processing even when scraping fails

### 3. Summary Generation Failures

**Problem**: HuggingFace summarization API intermittent failures

**Solutions Implemented**:

- ✅ **Retry Mechanism**: 2 retry attempts with 1-second delays
- ✅ **Content Validation**: Check content length before summarization
- ✅ **Graceful Handling**: Continue without summary if all attempts fail
- ✅ **Better Logging**: Detailed error reporting and success tracking

### 4. Cron Job Rate Limiting

**Problem**: Too many concurrent API calls overwhelming external services

**Solutions Implemented**:

- ✅ **Article Processing Delays**: 2-second delays between processing articles
- ✅ **Progress Logging**: Detailed progress tracking for transparency
- ✅ **Error Collection**: Collect but don't fail on individual article errors
- ✅ **Chunking Fallback**: Save articles even if embedding generation fails

## Code Changes Summary

### `/src/lib/chunk-embed.ts`

```typescript
// Before: Throws errors on API failure
export async function generateEmbedding(text: string): Promise<number[]>;

// After: Retry logic with fallback
export async function generateEmbedding(
  text: string,
  retryCount = 0
): Promise<number[]>;
```

**Key Improvements**:

- Exponential backoff retry logic (3 attempts)
- Zero vector fallback for failed embeddings
- Sequential processing instead of parallel batches
- Better error categorization and handling

### `/src/lib/news-fetcher.ts`

```typescript
// Before: Basic fetch with minimal error handling
async function scrapeArticleContent(url: string): Promise<string>;

// After: Timeout control and robust error handling
async function scrapeArticleContent(
  url: string,
  timeoutMs: number = 10000
): Promise<string>;
```

**Key Improvements**:

- AbortController for timeout management
- Enhanced browser headers for better compatibility
- Extended content selector coverage
- Timeout-specific error handling

### `/src/app/api/cron/daily-operations/route.ts`

```typescript
// Before: Process articles without rate limiting
for (const article of fetchedArticles) { ... }

// After: Sequential processing with delays
for (let i = 0; i < fetchedArticles.length; i++) {
  // Process with 2-second delays
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));
}
```

**Key Improvements**:

- 2-second delays between article processing
- Better error collection and reporting
- Graceful degradation when embedding fails
- Detailed progress logging

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Development Testing

```bash
# Test cron job manually
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/cron/daily-operations
```

### 2. Production Monitoring

- Monitor HuggingFace API error rates
- Track embedding generation success rates
- Watch for scraping timeout patterns
- Verify article processing completion

### 3. Error Recovery Validation

- Test with HuggingFace API quota exhausted
- Simulate network timeouts
- Verify zero vector fallbacks work correctly
- Confirm articles save without embeddings

## Expected Outcomes

### Immediate Improvements

- ✅ Reduced HuggingFace API failures through retry logic
- ✅ Better web scraping success rates with timeouts
- ✅ Graceful handling of individual article failures
- ✅ Continued operation even with partial API failures

### Long-term Stability

- ✅ More resilient to external API outages
- ✅ Better resource utilization through rate limiting
- ✅ Comprehensive error reporting for debugging
- ✅ Fallback mechanisms maintain core functionality

## Monitoring Metrics

### Success Indicators

- **Embedding Success Rate**: >90% successful embeddings
- **Scraping Success Rate**: >80% successful content extraction
- **Overall Completion**: Cron jobs complete without fatal errors
- **Article Processing**: All fetched articles get saved (with or without embeddings)

### Warning Thresholds

- **High Retry Rate**: >50% of embeddings requiring retries
- **Timeout Rate**: >30% of scraping attempts timing out
- **Zero Vector Rate**: >20% of embeddings using fallback
- **Processing Time**: >5 minutes per article on average

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Production**: Watch for the effectiveness of these fixes
2. **Performance Tuning**: Adjust timeouts and delays based on real-world performance
3. **Alternative Providers**: Consider backup embedding services if HuggingFace remains unreliable
4. **Caching Strategy**: Implement embedding caching to reduce API calls
5. **Content Prioritization**: Process higher-quality articles first

## Deployment Notes

- All changes are backward compatible
- No database migrations required
- Environment variables remain unchanged
- Existing article data is unaffected
- Cron job functionality is enhanced, not replaced

The production system should now be significantly more resilient to external API failures while maintaining full functionality through intelligent fallbacks and retry mechanisms.
